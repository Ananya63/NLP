Interestingly, the pandemic has exposed the risks and weaknesses of global interconnectedness, which will affect China’s BRI.Funding Shortfall for BRISo far, BRI has been powered primarily by China, whose growth rates were decreasing even before the outbreak. Exports Hit: With the United States and Europe reeling from the pandemic, Chinese exports will take a big hit.China confronts major Risk of debt on belt and road due to pandemicChina’s growth hit a near 30-year low of 6.1%Roughly 5 Million people in china lost their jobs in the first 2 months of 2020.Last February, China’s official urban unemployment jumped to an unprecedented 6.2 percent. Unemployed Number may go up to 9 million by the end of 2020.China will have to choose out of two competing priorities:So, not only may BRI be short of cash, but it will also be hard to sell at homeAll Economies along BRI routes affectedPakistan, host to the biggest BRI megaproject in the world, is poised to sustain a $8.2 billion loss, according to ADB. The respective figure for Bangladesh is $3 billion. Thailand is now bracing up for a recession. Africa is equally vulnerable, as China is the continent’s largest market.Covid19 hit Chinese companies executing BRI contracts can rely on support from the CDB in the form of low-cost financing. Yet, Chinese policy banks will be increasingly picky and inclined to stay away from new projects that may turn out to be loss-makers.China Development Bank to support Belt and road companies hit by coronavirus -XinhuaThe Coronavirus and Xi Jinping’s WorldviewPriority list:No. 1 preserving the CCP’s powerNo. 2 maintaining national unityNo. 3 the expansion of the economy No. 4 environmental sustainabilityNo. 5 modernize the Chinese militaryNo. 6 China’s 14 neighboring statesNo. 7 weaken America’s longstanding security alliances No. 8 terrestrial Silk Road Economic Belt No. 9 Maritime Silk RoadNo 10 reshape the global orderUnder extreme circumstances, Beijing will not consider the BRI as important.Is the BRI Finished then? Short Term: Yes, BRI will Face TroubleIn particular, the summer of 2020 may be a period of hibernation for several BRI projects.The outbreak has brought Chinese labor supplies and equipment imports along BRI routes down to a trickleNot Exactly!!! In fact, the initiative’s fuzzy content is being further enriched with the “Health Silk Road” add-on narrative and “mask diplomacy” in a major soft-power push.Long Term: A Changed BRI will EmergeThe BRI is bound to change. Strategies will change.It might even be Defined ProperlySeven years after this ambitious initiative was announced it remains a blurred vision in need of a comprehensive conceptual framework, international standards, and a coherent implementation strategy.This is one of the reasons why the BRI has become controversial and has caused a backlash in many countries.A Shift away from Roads and BridgesBRI expenditure up to 2019 stood at $545 billion. (WB Estimate) About two-thirds of spending on BRI projects has gone into the energy sector and transportHowever, developing countries in need of infrastructure will be terribly cash-strapped, there may be a shift away from roads, bridges, and coalfired power plants funded through Chinese loans.New BRI projects will probably be more strategically chosen. Beijing has been investing in the creation of a globe-spanning network of economic corridors, logistics zones, and financial centers, with stress laid on seaports and adjacent areas. Egypt’s Suez Canal Economic Zone and Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port City clearly show this trend.In addition, projects are likely to focus on more sophisticated forms of connectivity, such as 5G networks or, in the wake of the pandemic, disaster management, public health-related high-tech, and even remote surgery. China will surely use the BRI for the projection of its soft power, an increasingly important battlefield in international relations.The world has become aware of the risks of overwhelming reliance on China.Amid of Coronavirus outbreak we can see the major economies are strengthening their authorities with their major concernWe provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
